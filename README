# Introducing Kraken.. A Hashcat Discord Bot with Hashtopolis Integration

A Discord bot that submits hash cracking jobs to a Hashtopolis server, manages distributed cracking across remote agents, and reports cracked passwords back to users.

---

## Features

- Submit single hash cracking jobs via Discord commands
- Integration with Hashtopolis API for distributed cracking
- Trusted user role management in Discord
- Async job queue with concurrency control
- Dynamic onboarding instructions for Hashtopolis agents
- Input validation for supported hash algorithms
- Graceful handling of API errors and retries

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Discord bot token and bot added to your server
- Hashtopolis server set up and accessible
- Hashtopolis user credentials with API access
- Basic knowledge of running Python scripts and Discord bots

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pwnedsec-enki/KrakenBot.git
cd KrakenBot
````

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Edit a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:**

```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_token_here
HASHTOPOLIS_URL=http://your.hashtopolis.server
HASHTOPOLIS_USER=your_hashtopolis_username
HASHTOPOLIS_PASSWORD=your_hashtopolis_password
TRUSTED_ROLE_NAME=Trusted Agent
```

## Usage

1. **Run the bot**

```bash
python main_bot.py
```

2. **Discord Commands**

* `!register_agent`
  Sends you onboarding instructions to add your machine as a cracking agent.

* `!hashcat [algorithm] [hash]`
  Submit a single hash to be cracked using the specified algorithm.
  Example: `!hashcat md5 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592`

*Only users with the configured trusted role can run commands.*

---

## Supported Hash Algorithms

The bot validates hashes against the following supported algorithms (see `config.py`):

* md5
* sha1
* sha256
* ntlm
* bcrypt
* and more (full list in `config.py`)

---

## Development

* Modify or extend `hashcatbot.py` to add commands or features.
* Use `hashtopolis_manager.py` as the API client for Hashtopolis.
* Configure concurrency and queue settings inside the `JobProcessor` class.
* Logs are output to console for monitoring.

---

## Troubleshooting

* Check your `.env` for correct tokens and URLs.
* Verify Hashtopolis server accessibility and API user permissions.
* Ensure your Discord bot has the necessary intents and permissions.
* Use logs to diagnose API errors or job processing issues.
