Hi {username},

You’re now approved to join our Hashtopolis cracking network! Follow these steps to get your agent up and running:

1. **Install Python 3.7+**
   Verify you have at least Python 3.7:
     ```bash
     python3 --version
     ```
   If not installed, on Debian/Ubuntu run:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip
     ```
   Then install the required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip3 install --user requests psutil
     ```

2. **Unpack & build the agent**
   In the DM you’ve received a ZIP file. Run:
     ```bash
     unzip hashtopolis_agent.zip -d hashtopolis_agent
     cd hashtopolis_agent
     ./build.sh
     ```
   This will bundle everything into `hashtopolis.zip`.

3. **Start the agent**
   Once you have your hashtopolis.zip, run the following to register your device:
     ```bash
     python3 hashtopolis.zip \
       --url http://yourhashtopolishostnamehere:8080/api/server.php \
       --token "{agent_token}"
     ```
   This will register your machine and begin pulling work.

Once your agent shows up in the Hashtopolis web UI, an admin will activate it and your contributions will start cracking. If you run into any issues, just reply here or reach out to an admin.
