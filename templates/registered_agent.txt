Hi {username},

You're now approved to contribute a cracking agent to our distributed network.

To onboard your agent:

1. Install the Hashtopolis agent:
   https://github.com/s3inlc/hashtopolis/tree/master/agent

2. Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

3. Run the agent with the following command:

   python agent.py --server {server_url} --token {agent_token}

This token is one-time use only and will automatically register your machine as a new agent.

Once the agent appears in the Hashtopolis web UI, an admin will activate it.

Thanks for supporting the cracking grid.
